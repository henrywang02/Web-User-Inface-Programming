As part of my studies at JAMK University of Applied Sciences, I explored Web User Interface Programming, focusing on building dynamic, responsive, and interactive web applications. I gained hands-on experience with modern JavaScript frameworks and tools, emphasizing React and related technologies.

Key areas I covered include:

- Component-based Development: Building reusable and modular components in React.
- State Management: Managing application state effectively using hooks and advanced techniques.
- Routing: Implementing dynamic navigation with React Router and Next.js.
- Type Safety: Leveraging TypeScript to enhance code reliability and maintainability.
- Modern Tooling: Using Vite.js for fast development and improved build performance.
- Data Handling: Working with JSON for API interactions and data-driven interfaces.
- 
Through practical exercises and projects, I developed web applications that seamlessly integrate front-end logic with user-friendly interfaces, preparing me to build scalable and maintainable web solutions.
